This utility is made to supplement the walkthrough of Predynastic Egypt game.
The recommended mode is to place the utility window to the left side of the game window. Or you can Alt-tab to the tool. The window layout is adjusted accordingly to its size - Egypt map under Settlement map or to the right of it.

The utility shows your latest save file (including autosave) and automatically updates with every save. It's recommended to set autosave each turn in the game settings to always see fresh state in the utility.

Features:
------
1. Shows locations and resource of all tribes on both Settlement and Egypt maps
2. Shows the number of turns to explore an area. Set the checkbox "Accelerated exploration" if you are planning to finish exploration after acceleration start. The number of turns will be corrected accordingly.
3. If the area will be immediately explored after switching on the acceleraton, it's marked by red circle. You probably should remove a worker from here, unless you wish to complete the exploration without acceleration.
4. Shows total number of turns to finish all active scouting.
5. Shows 3 next events of a game for you to be prepared. Events of the next turn are shown in red, so consider saving a game.
6. Shows the number of turns (after the tribe resource symbol) needed to recharge your award for tribe robbery.
7. If your raid is about to complete next turn, but the award is not recharged yet, the area is marked by red circle. You probably should remove a worker from here.
8. If you are raiding a tribe and the reward is fully recharged, the area is marked by blue circle. You probably should assign a worker here.
